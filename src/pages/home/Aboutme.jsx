                    I began my coding odyssey with Python, where I learned the basics of programming and data manipulation.
        
                    Now, I'm thrilled to bring my Python skills to the world of Web3, looking to develop smart contracts, create blockchain-powered applications, and enhance decentralized platforms with AI.</p>
